## Unreleased

- Docs: the design and threat model for the Gemini paid-path broker (#205): a small unprivileged system service behind a
  socket unit that holds the paid key, the approval consumption records and the spend ledger, verifies the signed
  approval and makes the vendor call, with image generation as the first case. Documents only; no broker code, and
  paid use stays disabled.
- Gemini Tier 2: real WebAuthn assertion verification (ES256 and EdDSA) with the `cryptography` package, an optional
  hash-locked extra (`safo[passkeys]`). Opt-in; nothing in the approval path calls it and paid use stays disabled (#211).
- Guard: a dedicated entry point, `safo-guard` (and `python -m safo.guard`), so the hook never parses subcommands
  (#189). It reads only `--agents` and `--agents-local`, ignores every other word, and always computes the verdict.
- `safo hooks install` writes the new hook command and migrates an existing `safo hooks guard` line on a rerun.
  `safo hooks status` reports the installed form (new, legacy, mixed, absent) and takes `--settings`.
- Lines `safo hooks guard ...` already installed keep the frozen legacy routing. Re-installing the live hook is a
  separate, explicit step after the release.
